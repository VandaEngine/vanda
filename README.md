Open Source 3D Game Engine

About Vanda Engine

Vanda Engine is a free and open source development platform for Games and realtime interactive 3D on Windows. There are four modes in Vanda Engine: Prefab Mode, VScene Mode, GUI Mode, and Play Mode. Prefabs are the building block of Vanda Engine. You create your prefabs in Prefab mode. User Interfaces such as buttons and text are created in GUI mode. In VScene mode, you insert one or multiple instances of these prefabs and GUIs to build your level. Moreover, you can insert several built-in objects such as lights, sky, sounds, terrain, cameras and waters in your VScenes. In Prefab, GUI and VScene Modes, you can switch to Play Mode to play/test your scene.

We have published step by step tutorials about Vanda Engine, 3D tools, and COLLADA format:
